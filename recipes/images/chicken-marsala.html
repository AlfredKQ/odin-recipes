    <h3>The Chicken Marsala of All Marsalas</h3>
    <p>Chicken Marsala is a flavorful Italian entree with sauteed mushrooms and lean white meat simmered in a creamy wine sauce. Cook up a restaurant-quality dish your whole family will enjoy!</p>
    <p>Chicken marsala sounds fancy, but it’s a quick and easy meal to make on the stovetop. This recipe takes nuances from the traditional Italian Scaloppine, which has thin pieces of meat dredged in flour and then fried. The chicken breasts are lightly breaded then pan-seared to create a golden-brown crust. The sweet marsala wine sauce is a simple reduction, simmered until a creamy glaze sticks to each piece.</p>
    <p>The key is to flatten the meat to an even thickness for faster cooking and prevent it from drying out. Big slices of mushrooms cook with sweet marsala wine and cream to complement the chicken for a savory flavor. Serve with a big plate of pasta, crisp salad, and a glass of wine for the ultimate chicken dinner.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless chicken breasts, about 2 pounds total</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more for seasoning</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon black pepper, divided, plus more for seasoning</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ cup white onions, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ul>Place one of the chicken pieces between two plastic sheets or in a large plastic bag. Flatten to an even thickness, about ½-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces.</ul>
    <ul>Alternatively, for pieces larger than 1-inch thick and heavier than 8 ounces, cut in half horizontally. This should create eight ½-inch thick pieces.</ul>
    <ul>In a medium bowl, combine flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set aside.</ul>
    <ul>Lightly season each side of the chicken breast with salt and pepper. Dredge the pieces in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</ul>
    <ul>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil. Once hot, carefully add the chicken to the pan, presentation side down. Cook until golden brown, about 4 to 6 minutes.</ul>
    <ul>Reduce the heat to medium. Flip the pieces over and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 to 165ºF (71 to 74ºC), about 4 to 6 minutes. Fry in batches if needed. Transfer to a clean plate, loosely tent with foil to keep warm.</ul>
    <ul>To make the sauce, melt the butter. Add the onions and garlic, sauté for 1 minute, constantly stirring to ensure the garlic does not brown.</ul>
