        sausage gumbo! Smoky sausage, okra, and aromatic vegetables make this an authentic recipe
        perfect for sharing.</p>
    <p>New Orleans is a melting pot of extravagant culture, abundant energy, live music and it’s
        Creole cuisine. I traveled there a few years back for work, and I didn’t know it at the time,
        but when I had my first taste of delicious gumbo, I was hooked! It immediately became my
        favorite dish from Louisiana.</p>
    <p>A few days ago, my father-in-law handed me an amazing gift, a 15-year-old cookbook from his
        visit to the Crescent City! I quickly skimmed through it and found numerous recipes from some
        of the best restaurants at the time, like Commander’s Palace and Brennan’s. When I came across
        chicken Andouille sausage gumbo, I knew I had to give it a try and share with you the
        delicious results.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chicken, boneless skinless breast and thigh recommended</li>
        <li>2 quarts water</li>
        <li>1 pound okra, 1-inch slices (cut and frozen if fresh is not available)</li>
        <li>½ cup water, to cook the okra</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups yellow onion, ¼-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bell pepper, ¼-inch dice, green and red</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        <li>In a medium-sized pot, add chicken breast and thighs and cover with 2 quarts of water. Bring water to a boil, then simmer until fully cooked about 20 to 25 minutes.
            Strain water and reserve.</li>
        <li>Remove cooked chicken from the pot, allow it to cool then shred into small pieces. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, add okra and ½ cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover. Simmer for 7-9 minutes until tender, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Transfer okra to a colander, drain, then reserve.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, combine ½ cup unsalted butter and ½ cup flour. Cook over medium heat, frequently stirring with a whisk to make a dark brown roux, about 15 minutes. In the last 5 minutes make sure to continuously stir so the roux does not burn.</li>
        <li>Add onion, bell peppers, celery, and garlic. Sauté until vegetables are tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooked okra, tomatoes, and sliced Andouille sausage. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
